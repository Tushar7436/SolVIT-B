InsightLoop

InsightLoop is a comprehensive ML based sorting program which can act as an intermediator in handling and sorting queries reducing the stress on agencies in handling mass amount of queries by revolutionizing how the queries are handled.

What it does
Spam Detection & Filtering – Removes irrelevant or fraudulent feedback.
Service Classification – Categorizes queries into domains like electricity, water, gas, etc.
Sentiment Analysis – Predicts user satisfaction levels.
Priority Assignment – Ensures urgent queries are addressed first.

Features ;-
As of right now our program can be implemented on train system management but due to its versatile nature it can be implemented on other kind of public system managements like - Electricity , water and other govt. agency departments , moreover with an adequate enough dataset and proper training it can also be implemented in various educational and enterprise agencies.

Working of system ;-
1. Start: Collect feedback from the public.
2. Spam Detection: Check if the feedback is spam. 
                Yes (Spam?): Filter out spam feedback. 
                No (Spam?): Proceed to the next step. 
3. Classify Query: Categorize feedback based on its content. 
                 Yes (Service Domain?): 
                 Determine the specific service domain (electricity, water, gas). 
4.Analyze Feedback: Extract insights and detect patterns from the feedback. 
5. Predict Satisfaction: Assess user satisfaction based on feedback content. 
6. Assign Priority: Set the urgency level for further action or response. 
7. End: Complete the process by managing the feedback accordingly.

We have developed a robust API using Python to seamlessly integrate and manage the Train Management System's backend functionalities. The API ensures efficient data handling and smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.
